Phishing Detector Website â€“ Cyberthon Project
1. Project Overview & Features
This phishing detection website will allow users to analyze URLs, images (screenshots of emails/websites), and videos (screen recordings) using AI. The system will process inputs in real-time and provide risk classifications (Safe, Suspicious, Phishing) along with detailed threat explanations (e.g., suspicious domain, fake login pages, hidden redirects). Users can contribute to a crowdsourced phishing database by reporting threats, while a security dashboard will track analysis history, phishing statistics, and security tips. Additionally, a browser extension will enable direct link analysis from web pages, ensuring real-time security while browsing.

To enhance accessibility, users will have multiple input methods:

Website Interface: Users can manually enter links, upload images, or submit videos for phishing analysis.
Browser Extension: Provides real-time scanning of visited links, alerting users to potential threats.
Mobile & API Integration (Future Scope): Plans to support phishing detection via mobile apps and third-party API integrations for seamless protection.
2. Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js or Next.js for a dynamic, interactive UI.
Backend: FastAPI or Flask (Python) for AI-based phishing detection.
Database: Firebase/Firestore or PostgreSQL for storing user reports.
AI Models:
URL Analysis: ML-based phishing classification (domain reputation, SSL validation, and blacklist checks).
Image Analysis: OCR (Tesseract/Google Vision API) and computer vision to detect fake login pages.
Video Analysis: Extracting key frames and running phishing detection on image sequences.
Hosting & Deployment:
Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
Backend: Render/AWS/GCP
Database: Firebase/MongoDB Atlas
3. Core Functionalities
Phishing Detection: Analyze URLs, webpage content, images, and videos using AI-powered classification.
Analysis Dashboard: A dedicated platform where users can submit inputs for phishing detection.
Crowdsourced Database: Users can report phishing links to improve detection accuracy.
Browser Extension Support: Enable real-time link scanning from within web browsers.
User Authentication (Optional): Firebase Auth (Google OAuth) to track reports and provide personalized insights.
4. UI/UX Design
A clean, minimal interface with instant result feedback and color-coded risk levels (Green = Safe, Yellow = Suspicious, Red = Phishing). Results will include detailed reports highlighting phishing elements. The site will feature a responsive design, dark mode, and accessibility support for usability.

5. Security & Testing
Security Measures: HTTPS enforcement, input sanitization, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Testing:
Unit Testing: Validate AI predictions and API responses.
Load Testing: Ensure backend stability under high traffic.
Data Protection: Prevent tampering of user-submitted phishing reports.
6. Bonus Features
Gamification: Reward users for reporting phishing sites.
Dark Web Scanning: Identify potential threats linked to cybercrime networks.
Security Reports: Generate insights on phishing trends and attack patterns.
